BioMaS Galaxy
=============

Requirements
------------

Xfvb is needed to run ese2, without X.org server. On CentOS:

```
# yum install xorg-x11-server-Xvfb
```

On Ubuntu:
```
# apt-get install libxrender1 libsm6 libxt6
```

Usearch is also needed. It is not distributed with BioMaS, due to its licence. Download it and move it in `/usr/bin`.

Copy the New_TANGO_perl_version in `/home/galaxy`.
