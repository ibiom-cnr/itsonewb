How to register in ITSoneWB
===========================

As explained above, the access to ITSoneWB is not restricted and anonymous users are allowed. Nonetheless, the registration is highly recommended and, currently, does not require any approval from the
service provider.

In order to register to ITSoneWB, the user needs just to access the home page by using the `link <http://itsonewb.cloud.ba.infn.it/galaxy>`_ and select "*Login or register*" (red arrow in the Supplementary Figure 2).
