ITSoneDB vs. shotgun mapping tool
=================================

The ITS1 *shotgun mapping* service allows to identify and eventually taxonomically classify ITS1 regions in metagenomic shotgun data.

*ITSoneDB vs. shotgun mapping tool* is able to analyse both single-end (SE) and paired-end (PE) fastq files. It exploits query sequence mapping on the ITSoneDB collection by using bowtie2, in both end-to-end (similar to a global alignment) and local modality. The resulting alignments are then filtered according to query coverage and similarity. Finally, a list of ITS1 sequences are returned.

It is important to note the choice between the single-end and the paired-end mapping may influence the results. In particular, in PE mapping both the reads must pass the query coverage threshold.

*Supplementary Figure 10: A schematic representation of the mapping schema implemented in the tool. Red and blue lines correspond, respectively, to paired- and single-end reads. For PE reads, R1 and R2 represents the forward and the reverse reads, respectively.*

In Figure *upplementary Figure 10* 4 hypothetical mapping situations are  represented. In the first one (A) both the PE mates align to the ITS1 reference for more than 70% of their length, so assuming the identity percentage (measured as the mean of the similarity obtained by each mate) is higher than the imposed threshold, this alignment is retained. In the second case (B), the R1 aligns to the reference for less than 70% and consequently the PE alignment is completely filtered-out. Single-end cases are more simple because we check the requirements for each read independently (C is retained and D not).

Taking into account the mapping and filtering modalities, the user needs to choice between the following parameters:

-   Single or Paired, file or collection: type of input files;

-   Bowtie 2 indexes: ITSoneDB reference collection;

-   Identity percentage threshold: the identity percentage filtering threshold to consider the alignment relevant (default ≥ 97%);

-   Coverage of the query sequence: the query coverage filtering threshold to consider the alignment relevant (default ≥ 70%);

-   Number of bowtie2 matches: maximum number of relevant alignments retrieved per each query sequence (or paired-end sequence).

In *Supplementary Figure 10*, a simulation of single-end data analysis by using default parameters is shown.

The result of the analysis is a tubular text file listing the query sequences matching with ITS1 sequences.

For testing purpose, we uploaded test input for BioMaS, in Galaxy shared library. The same inputs can be used for this tool. These can be exported to Galaxy history and used also by anonymous users.

Install on Galaxy
-----------------

Galaxy is able to automatically solve conda dependecies when a tool is started.

To install the ITS1 to ITSoneDB tool on Galaxy:

#. Clone the ITSoneWb repository

   ::

     git clone https://github.com/ibiom-cnr/itsonewb.git

#. Add the TSoneDB Connector entry in the galaxy ``tool_conf.xml`` file with your favourite editor:

   ::

     <section name="ITSoneDB" id="itsonedb">
         <tool file="/path_to_itsonewb/itsonewb/ITS1_parser_ITSoneDB_wrapper/ITS1_mapper_and_parser_ITSoneDB_wrapper.xml" />
     </section>

#. Finally restart Galaxy.

Reference data
--------------

ITSoneDB (r131) BioMaS indexes can be downloaded `here <http://cloud.recas.ba.infn.it:8080/v1/AUTH_3b4918e0a982493e8c3ebcc43586a2a8/ITSoneWB/itsonedb_r131_biomas_indexes.tar.gz>`_.

The archive includes the Bowtie2 indexes, i.e. ``bowtie2_indexes_rel131/ITSITSoneDB_all_euk_r131*`` files.

To include them in Galaxy, please refer to the `Galaxy Project documnetation <https://galaxyproject.org/admin/tools/data-tables/>`_. The ``*loc`` files are on our github repository (``ITS1_parser_ITSoneDB_wrapper/tool-data``) with the corresponding ``tool_data_table_conf.xml`` entry.


Docker version
--------------

The tool is also packaged as Docker Container, hosted on `DockerHub <https://hub.docker.com/r/ibiomcnr/its-to-itsonedb>`_.

You can pull it from DockerHub with the following command:

::

  docker push ibiomcnr/its-to-itsonedb

.. note::

   The ITS1 to ITSoneDB docker container includes the ITSoneDB reference data on ``/refdata/itsonedb_biomas_indexes/ITSoneDB_all_euk_r131``.
