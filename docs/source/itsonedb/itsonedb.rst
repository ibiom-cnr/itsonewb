ITSoneDB
========

ITSoneDB is a comprehensive collection of eukaryotic ribosomal RNA Internal Transcribed Spacer 1 (ITS1) sequences. It is aimed at supporting metabarcoding surveys of fungal and other microbial eukaryotic environmental communities. The sequences were extracted from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) and arranged on the NCBI taxonomy tree. ITS1 start and end boundaries were defined by ENA annotations and/or designed by mapping Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profiles of flanking 18S and 5.8S ribosomal RNA coding genes on each sequence.

The ITSoneDB tool embeds two services: **ITSoneDB Connector** and **ITSoneDB vs. shotgun mapping tool**.
