Primer Design
-------------

The Primer Design service uses the mopo16S tool to infer the best primer
pair able to amplify the ITS1 belonging to the taxonomic clade settled
by the user.

Initially, the user needs to apply the "*Prepare primer input inference
file*" tool, allowing to extract all the ITS1 sequences available for a
specific clade in ITSoneDB.

The user must select the taxonomic clade of interest. In order to
streamline the taxon name searching an interactive drop-down menu is
available. The sequence clustering ("Enable clustering" button) is
enabled by default and may be disabled only for datasets with less than
1000 sequences. Once executed, the tool will generate a fasta sequences
collection that will constitute the mopo16S tool input.

Following, the primer inference is performed by using the mopo16S tools.

The tool execution requires 2 mandatory inputs:

1.  Reference dataset file: a fasta collection of target sequences
    uploaded by the users or generated by using the *Prepare primer
    input inference file* tool;

2.  Reference primer file: mopo16s requires an initial primer set to
    eventually infer new primers. Otherwise a primer pair can be
    provided by the system \[PMID:25077016\].

It is also possible to set advanced parameters, for whose description we
suggest to visit the [[developer
site]{.underline}](https://www.dei.unipd.it/~baruzzog/mopo16S.html).

mopo16S starts by inferring the efficiency (a measure of the
amplification capacity of each primer), the coverage ("virtually
amplified" sequences in input collection) and the matching-bias
(mismatches between primers and input sequences) of the submitted primer
pairs. Then infers a new primer pair (or a set of pairs) that maximise
the efficiency and coverage and minimize the matching-bias.

Three outputs are produced:

1.  Efficiency, coverage and matching bias of the input primer pair;

2.  A list of new primers;

3.  Efficiency, coverage and matching bias of the new designed primers;
